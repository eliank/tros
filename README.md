# Tros [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wvanbergen/tros.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/wvanbergen/tros)

This is a cleanup fork of the Avro gem.

Reasons:
- Get rid of yajl/multi_json dependency
- Drop support for Ruby 1.8 
- Add proper unicode support.
- Not being stuck to Apache Avro project release schedule
- Public CI.

## Usage

For now, the API is the same as the Avro API. Just replace `Avro` with `Tros`.

## Tros?

The name Tros probably only makes sense to Dutch people.
